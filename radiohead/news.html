            <p>For the frontman of a band famous for soaring anthems and grandiose artistic statements, Thom Yorke’s solo material always seemed a little underwhelming. The stuttering beats and glitchy textures he disappeared into were broody and introverted, his cold, skeletal songs travelling way beyond Radiohead’s more experimental excursions. <br/><br/>
                Of course, no-one expects Yorke to whip out an acoustic guitar and start strumming <span class="song">"Fake Plastic Trees"</span> in 2018, but intrigue around precisely how he’d bring such music to life means expectations around this short, European tour are high. <br/><br/>
                Shuffling on stage to rapturous applause, the haunting piano of <span class="song">"Interference"</span> is a gentle introduction, even with an ominous drone buzzing away under the surface. But then the woozy, wobbly <span class="song">"A Brain In A Bottle"</span> starts up and Yorke’s away, poking and twisting at his modern boxes one minute; losing himself completely in the beat the next. </p>
